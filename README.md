FOREMOST 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Foremost is a Linux program to recover files based on their headers and
footers. Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd,
Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers are
specified by a configuration file, so you can pick and choose which
headers you want to look for.



--------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING FOREMOST
--------------------------------------------


To run foremost, you must:
```bash
- uncompress the archive
- compile
- install
```
Here's how to do it:

```Linux:```
```console
$ tar zxvf foremost-xx.tar.gz
$ cd foremost-xx
$ make
$ make install
```
---
```BSD:```

```console
$ tar zxvf foremost-xx.tar.gz
$ cd foremost-xx
$ make unix
$ make install
```
---
```Solaris:```

```console
$ tar zxvf foremost-xx.tar.gz
$ cd foremost-xx
$ make solaris
$ make install
```
---
```OSX:```

```console
$ tar zxvf foremost-xx.tar.gz
$ cd foremost-xx
$ make mac
$ make macinstall
```
On systems with older versions of glibc (earlier than 2.2.0), you will get 
some harmless warnings about ftello and fseeko not being defined. You can 
ignore these.

FOREMOST(1)                                                                                General Commands Manual                                                                                FOREMOST(1)

NAME
       foremost - Recover files using their headers, footers, and data structures

SYNOPSIS
       foremost[-h][-V][-d][-vqwQT][-b<blocksize>][-o<dir>] [-t<type>][-s<num>][-i<file>]

BUILTIN FORMATS
       Recover files from a disk image based on file types specified by the user using the -t switch.

       jpg    Support for the JFIF and Exif formats including implementations used in modern digital cameras.

       gif

       png

       bmp    Support for windows bmp format.

       avi

       exe    Support for Windows PE binaries, will extract DLL and EXE files along with their compile times.

       mpg    Support for most MPEG files (must begin with 0x000001BA)

       mp4

       wav

       riff   This will extract AVI and RIFF since they use the same file format (RIFF). note faster than running each separately.

       wmv    Note may also extract -wma files as they have similar format.

       mov

       pdf

       ole    This will grab any file using the OLE file structure.  This includes PowerPoint, Word, Excel, Access, and StarWriter

       doc    Note it is more efficient to run OLE as you get more bang for your buck.  If you wish to ignore all other ole files then use this.

       zip    Note  is will extract .jar files as well because they use a similar format.  Open Office docs are just zip'd XML files so they are extracted as well.  These include SXW, SXC, SXI, and SX? for
              undetermined OpenOffice files.  Office 2007 files are also XML based (PPTX,DOCX,XLSX)

       rar

       htm

       cpp    C source code detection, note this is primitive and may generate documents other than C code.

       all    Run all pre-defined extraction methods. [Default if no -t is specified]

DESCRIPTION
       Recover files from a disk image based on headers and footers specified by the user.

       -h     Show a help screen and exit.

       -V     Show copyright information and exit.

       -d     Turn on indirect block detection, this works well for Unix file systems.

       -T     Time stamp the output directory so you don't have to delete the output dir when running multiple times.

       -v     Enables verbose mode. This causes more information regarding the current state of the program to be displayed on the screen, and is highly recommended.

       -q     Enables quick mode. In quick mode, only the start of each sector is searched for matching headers. That is, the header is searched only up to the length of the longest header. The rest of the
              sector,  usually  about  500 bytes, is ignored. This mode makes foremost run considerably faster, but it may cause you to miss files that are embedded in other files. For example, using quick
              mode you will not be able to find JPEG images embedded in Microsoft Word documents.

              Quick mode should not be used when examining NTFS file systems. Because NTFS will store small files inside the Master File Table, these files will be missed during quick mode.

       -Q     Enables Quiet mode. Most error messages will be suppressed.

       -w     Enables write audit only mode.  No files will be extracted.

       -a     Enables write all headers, perform no error detection in terms of corrupted files.

       -b number
              Allows you to specify the block size used in foremost.  This is relevant for file naming and quick searches.  The default is 512.       ie.  foremost -b 1024 image.dd

       -k number
              Allows you to specify the chunk size used in foremost.  This can improve speed if you have enough RAM to fit the image in.  It reduces the checking that occurs between chunks of  the  buffer.
              For example if you had > 500MB of RAM.       ie.  foremost -k 500 image.dd

       -i file
              The file is used as the input file.  If no input file is specified or the input file cannot be read then stdin is used.

       -o directory
              Recovered files are written to the directory directory.

       -c file
              Sets  the configuration file to use. If none is specified, the file "foremost.conf" from the current directory is used, if that doesn't exist then "/etc/foremost.conf" is used. The format for
              the configuration file is described in the default configuration file included with this program. See the CONFIGURATION FILE section below for more information.

       -s number
              Skips number blocks in the input file before beginning the search for headers.       ie.  foremost -s 512 -t jpeg -i /dev/hda1

       CONFIGURATION FILE
              The configuration file is used to control what types of files foremost searches for. A sample configuration file, foremost.conf, is included with this distribution. For each  file  type,  the
              configuration  file  describes  the  file's extension, whether the header and footer are case sensitive, the maximum file size, and the header and footer for the file. The footer field is op‐
              tional, but header, size, case sensitivity, and extension are not!

              Any line that begins with a pound sign is considered a comment and ignored. Thus, to skip a file type just put a pound sign at the beginning of that line

              Headers and footers are decoded before use. To specify a  value  in  hexadecimal  use  \x[0-f][0-f],  and  for  octal  use  \[1-9][1-9][1-9].   Spaces  can  be  represented  by  \s.  Example:
              "\x4F\123\I\sCCI" decodes to "OSI CCI".

              To match any single character (aka a wildcard) use a ?. If you need to search for the ? character, you will need to change the wildcard line *and* every occurrence of the old wildcard charac‐
              ter in the configuration file. Do not forget those hex and octal values! ? is equal to \x3f and \063.

              There is a sample set of headers in the README file.

EXAMPLES
       Search for jpeg format skipping the first 100 blocks
              foremost -s 100 -t jpg -i image.dd

       Only generate an audit file, and print to the screen (verbose mode)
              foremost -av image.dd

       Search all defined types
              foremost -t all -i image.dd

       Search for gif and pdf's
              foremost -t gif,pdf -i image.dd

       Search for office documents and jpeg files in a Unix file system in verbose mode.
              foremost -vd -t ole,jpeg -i image.dd

       Run the default case
              foremost image.dd

CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
--------------------------------------------

The configuration file is used to control what types of files foremost
searches for. A sample configuration file, foremost.conf, is included with
this distribution. For each file type, the configuration file describes
the file's extension, whether the header and footer are case sensitive,
the maximum file size, and the header and footer for the file. The footer
field is optional, but header, size, case sensitivity, and extension are
not!

Any line that begins with a '#' is considered a comment and ignored. Thus,
to skip a file type just put a '#' at the beginning of that line

Headers and footers are decoded before use. To specify a value in
hexadecimal use \x[0-f][0-f], and for octal use \[0-7][0-7][0-7].  Spaces
can be represented by \s. Example: "\x4F\123\I\sCCI" decodes to "OSI CCI".

To match any single character (aka a wildcard) use a '?'. If you need to
search for the '?' character, you will need to change the 'wildcard' line
*and* every occurrence of the old wildcard character in the configuration
file. Don't forget those hex and octal values! '?' is equal to 0x3f and
\063.

Here's a sample set of headers and footers:
```bash
# extension  case-sens  max-size   header			footer		(option)
#
# GIF and JPG files (very common)
	gif	y	155000	\x47\x49\x46\x38\x37\x61	\x00\x3b
  	gif	y 	155000	\x47\x49\x46\x38\x39\x61	\x00\x00\x3b
  	jpg	y	200000	\xff\xd8\xff			\xff\xd9
```
Note: the option is a method of specifying additional options.  Current the following options exist:

FORWARD: Specify to search from the header to the footer (optional) up to the max-size.
REVERSE: Specify to search from the footer to the header up to the max-size.
NEXT: Specify to search from the header to the data just past the footer.  This allows you to  specify data that you know is 'NOT' in the data you are looking for and should terminated the search, up to the max-size.
